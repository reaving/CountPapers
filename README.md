Create a folder called "papers" in your Windower\addons folder.

Copy the papers.lua file into this folder.

To load the add-on in your windower console, type "lua r papers".

To run the code in your windower console, type "papers run".

Note: Test it in your mog house first!  Don't just go out in public in the middle of Jueno to test run it! lol

Here is a sample output:
```
Papers: ....Papers - START....
